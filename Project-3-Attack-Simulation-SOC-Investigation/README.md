# 🛡️ Project 3 – Attack Simulation & SOC Investigation

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete SOC investigation workflow through controlled attack simulation and endpoint telemetry analysis within an isolated lab environment.

The project is divided into two phases:

- Phase 1: Safe attack simulation and telemetry observation
- Phase 2: Malware execution investigation and incident response workflow

The objective is to simulate realistic attack behavior and demonstrate how a SOC analyst detects, analyzes, and contains malicious activity.

## Project Goals

- Simulate attacker behavior in a controlled environment
- Capture endpoint telemetry using Sysmon
- Investigate malicious process activity
- Detect suspicious registry and network behavior
- Perform containment actions
- Document findings using SOC investigation methodology

---

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 – Safe Attack Simulation
In Phase 1, safe attack simulations were conducted to understand how malicious activity appears in system logs.

Focus areas:
- Attack simulation setup
- Telemetry observation
- Log collection
- Understanding baseline system behavior

### Phase 2 – Malware Execution Investigation
In Phase 2, a malware execution scenario was investigated using endpoint telemetry to simulate real SOC incident response.

Focus areas:
- Malware execution detection
- Registry modification analysis
- Process injection detection
- DNS and network communication analysis
- Incident containment
- Endpoint recovery
